Introduction
============
LocalFark is a screen-scraper for Fark (http://www.fark.com/) and
TotalFark (http://www.totalfark.com/).  It can save to RSS and/or a
MySQL database.


System Requirements
===================
- Ruby 1.6.8 (Ruby 1.8 should work as well)
  http://www.ruby-lang.org/
- MySQL-Ruby
  http://www.tmtm.org/en/mysql/ruby/
- PHP 4.2.1 (optional, for the web interface)
  http://www.php.net/


Getting Started
===============
Take a look at config/fark.rb or config/totalfark.rb, depending on the
site you want to scrape (TotalFark requires an account; no, you can't
have mine).  

Once you've customized the template for your particular setup, copy it
to $HOME/.localfark.rb (LocalFark will complain and exit if this file
doesn't exist).

To use the MySQL backend, set :use_db? to true in the config file, and
use the following command to create the LocalFark table:

  # create mysql localfark table
  mysql -u USER -p DATABASE < localfark.sql

Where USER is your MySQL username, and DATABASE is database to create
the table under (you'll need to add those settings to your config file
as well).

By using this scraper, you're denying Fark some advertising revenue.  As
penance, you might consider going to Fark occasionally and clicking on
some banners to compensate.
